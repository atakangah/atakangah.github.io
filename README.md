# Research Interests
I lead the software engineering team at minoHealth & KaraAgro AI Labs. My team builds software for both companies from scratch all the way to deployment and maintenance. We participate in research within the AI department at the company. I am currently focused on AI forensics which is a new and emerging field to watermark generative AI output. I am also interested in Programming Languages, Embedded and Operating Systems, and I am happy to participate in research on LLMs as Operating Systems.
